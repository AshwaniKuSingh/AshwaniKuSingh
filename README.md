## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ashwani Kumar Singh

- Thanks for popping by! As an avid learner, bold builder, curious explorer, and driven doer with a bias towards action, I enjoy seeking and solving meaningful problems with data and technology while having fun at the same time. 
- You can find my data science portfolio below, where every project and article was born out of inspiration, curiosity, and motivation. Feel free to reach out for a chat on topics common to both of us!
